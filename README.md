## ✨ About Me
I’m a business student passionate about **data analytics, finance, compliance, and research**. I love turning messy data into insights, solving real-world problems, and communicating findings clearly. I’m always learning new tools and techniques that help bridge business, finance, and technology. I'm actively involved both on and off campus. I am a Break Through Tech AI/ML Fellow and the VP of Alumnae Relations at the Women in Business Club at Baruch College. I am also a member of the ISACA Cybersecurity Club.
